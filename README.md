# Cube-Dodge
A game I created based off of a premise made by github.com/HarshitSheoran
In the unity resources directory lies all of the code and unity assests.
In the compiled folder is the actual game for PC. The game was originally intended for mobile.
There are two scenes, full working and shop, both of the scenes are under /scenes/

A preview of the game:
